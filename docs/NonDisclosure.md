# Non-Disclosure Guidelines

Version: 16 August 2023

Fixed in 12 January 2024

----

1. This is not really NDA[^1], since Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers is not an officially commercial project at the moment, but it's important to follow Non-Disclosure Guidelines if you're a member of BvS Discord Server[^2].
2. Disclosure outside of BvS Discord Server[^2] is forbidden everywhere: in DM, in any community, in any other website/app. Unless it's published in [the progress report](https://discord.com/channels/1040941619488239638/1140272532071661638).
3. To give free modding capabilities and make it possible for community to keep maintaining the project even if we won't be able to continue working on it, the <u>code</u> and <u>ideas</u> are planned to become open-source in the indefinite future — but until we have a playable version of any game for general public (only <u>stable</u> builds count, not beta/alpha/early dev/demo), everything is <u>closed-source</u> and restricted to BvS Discord Server[^2].
4. Soundtrack is a separate part of the project. It'll be included to the compiled builds, but it won't be open-source, project files won't be published, unless some composers decide to do it with their own compositions.
    1. Composers are not allowed to publish project files of the other composers' work or recreate those project files for public use.
5. Don't use/share any artwork without artist's explicit permission. Don't use/share any AI generations with anyone outside of BvS Discord Server[^2], since they could disclose some ideas of Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers.
6. Non-Disclosure Guidelines are subject to change during project development. Everyone in BvS Discord Server[^2] will be notified about these changes.
7. Non-Disclosure Guidelines still must be followed if you're no longer a member of BvS Discord Server[^2].

[^1]: Non-disclosure agreement <sup>[\[Wikipedia\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement)</sup>, a legal document which is used in almost any company. This kind of documents can't be used in Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers project, due to its officially non-commercial indie nature — therefore, there are <u>guidelines</u> instead, which are <u>recommended</u> to follow until the project becomes legally official (this means registering as an indie project to publish on online marketplaces like Steam/Google Play and make official profits).
