# Non-Disclosure Guidelines

Version: 16 August 2023

- This is not really NDA, since this is not an officially commercial project at the moment, but it's important to follow these guidelines if you're a member of this server.
- This is a copy of Non-Disclosure Guidelines from GitHub repository of this project: https://github.com/puvs/BombsVsSleepwalkers
- Disclosure outside of this Discord server is forbidden everywhere: in DM, in any community, in any other website/app. Unless it's published in #ðŸ“¢ï¸±progress-report.
- To give free modding capabilities and make it possible for community to keep maintaining the project even if we won't be able to continue working on it, the __code__ and __ideas__ are planned to become open-source in the future â€” but until then, until we have a playable version of any game for general public (only __stable__ builds count, not beta/alpha/early dev/demo), everything is __closed-source__ and restricted to this server.
- Soundtrack is a separate part of the project. It'll be included to the compiled builds, but it won't be open-source, project files won't be published, unless some composers decide to do it with their own compositions.
  - Composers are not allowed to publish project files of the other composers' work or recreate those project files for public use.
- Don't use/share any artwork without artist's explicit permission. Don't use/share any AI generations with anyone outside of this Discord server, since they could disclose some ideas of this project.
- Non-disclosure guidelines are subject to change during project development. Everyone in this Discord server will be notified about these changes.
- These guidelines still must be followed if you're no longer a member of this server but you have any saved content.
- TBA.

Current version of Non-Disclosure Guidelines is approved by: _(needs to be finished first)_
