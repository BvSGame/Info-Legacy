# Non-Disclosure Guidelines

Version: 16 August 2023

- This is not really NDA, since Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers is not an officially commercial project at the moment, but it's important to follow these guidelines if you're a member of BvS Discord Server[^1].
- Disclosure outside of BvS Discord Server[^1] is forbidden everywhere: in DM, in any community, in any other website/app. Unless it's published in [#ðŸ“¢ï¸±progress-report](https://discord.com/channels/1040941619488239638/1140272532071661638).
- To give free modding capabilities and make it possible for community to keep maintaining the project even if we won't be able to continue working on it, the <u>code</u> and <u>ideas</u> are planned to become open-source in the future â€” but until we have a playable version of any game for general public (only <u>stable</u> builds count, not beta/alpha/early dev/demo), everything is <u>closed-source</u> and restricted to BvS Discord Server[^1].
- Soundtrack is a separate part of the project. It'll be included to the compiled builds, but it won't be open-source, project files won't be published, unless some composers decide to do it with their own compositions.
  - Composers are not allowed to publish project files of the other composers' work or recreate those project files for public use.
- Don't use/share any artwork without artist's explicit permission. Don't use/share any AI generations with anyone outside of BvS Discord Server[^1], since they could disclose some ideas of Bombs vs. Sleepwalkers.
- Non-disclosure guidelines are subject to change during project development. Everyone in BvS Discord Server[^1] will be notified about these changes.
- These guidelines still must be followed if you're no longer a member of BvS Discord Server[^1] but you have any saved content.
